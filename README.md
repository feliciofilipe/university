- ##### 2nd semester

  - (16/20) [Software Labs II](/1st/LI2):
    This project is a version of the `Reversi` board game built in C.
    
### **2nd year**

- ##### 2nd semester

  - (19/20) [Software Labs III](/2nd/LI3):
    This project is a modular Sales Management System done twice in C and JAVA.
    - #### :star: Best Group Project Grade in this Class (2019/2020).
  - (18/20) [Object Oriented Programming](/2nd/POO):
    This project is a Command Line Application for a delivery system built in the JAVA
    programming language using abstraction and reflections to automatically generate the app user interface (View) from the Model. 
    - #### :star: Best Group Project Grade in this Class (2019/2020).
  - (19.4/20) [Program Calculation](/2nd/CP):
    This project follows program design by calculation methods with literate
    programming principles using Haskell and `lhs2TeX`.
    - #### :star: Best Group Project Grade in this Class (2019/2020).

  - (18/20) [Operating Systems](/2nd/SO): A client/server application to process and apply filters to audio files with limited resources managment and file configuration.
    
### **3rd year**

- ##### 1st semester
   
  - (18/20) [Software Development Systems](/3rd/1st/DSS/wms):
    This project is a Warehouse Managment System in Java, with a beautiful GUI in JavaFX, capable of managing an robot automated warehouse with multiple different  users at the same time - using an     online database. Additionally we built a Web App capable of requesting Orders to the warehouse coded in JavaScript. Like in previous Java projects we made a terminal shell (now its used more as a development tool to quickly test queries and debug) that is generated automatically from the model source code using abstraction and reflextions.  
    - #### :star: Best Group Project Grade in this Class (2020/2021).

## :pray: Special Thanks

Also I would like to give an individual special shout out to this person for being a 
huge role model, setting the example of great work ethic and organization (I have model this repository from him) 
and by far the person from whom I have learned the most within the software engineering students community.
